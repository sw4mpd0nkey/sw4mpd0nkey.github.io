While doing some of the challenge labs for the OSCP I realized my windows skills are lacking so I decided to pause and go through the [Cyber Mentors](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCyberMentor) windows privledge escalation course through his company [TCM Security](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/). I'll be working through this the next couple days most likely and will add smalll write upts on the boxes done as a part of this course.
